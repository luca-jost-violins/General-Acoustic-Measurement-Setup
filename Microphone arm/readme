These are models for different microphone arm widths. Depending on your printer's tolerances, the standard microphone arm might be too loose or too tight. The models marked with a minus are less wide so would provide a looser fit than the normal model. Those marked with a plus are wider so would provide a tighter fit. If you are using a printing service, I would recommend printing a few variations, as it should not be much more expensive and could make things easier for you. If you have a too loose or too tight fit and printing another microphone arm is not an option, you can either add a thin layer of CA glue to one side of the microphone arm or shave off small amounts of material from the microphone arm using a plane or sandpaper to achieve a tighter or looser fit respectively.
